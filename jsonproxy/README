This is the source for JSON Proxy, a sample App Engine app that provides a
proxy for JavaScript applications to access XML data on other domains.  This
app runs publicly at http://jsonproxy.appspot.com.

More about the proxy can be seen at the about page at
http://jsonproxy.appspot.com/about

The source was originally written by Nathan Naze.


Running the application:

* Step 1:  Get the source.  Go to the directory you'd like to put the source in
  and run:

$ svn checkout http://jsonproxy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jsonproxy-read-only  

* Step 2: Get simplejson.

While Python 2.6 has a built in json module, Google App Engine runs Python 2.5,
and thus the module is not loaded.  So, instead, it uses simplejson, which
is a JSON encoder/decoder written in Python.  You can get it here:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

For the devserver to import simplejson, it has to be available in its path.  
You can simply put simplejson in the root of the app, or make a symlink to
where the simplejson is on your system.  simplejson will also have to
go along with the rest of the app when uploaded to App Engine.

* Step 3: Run.

In Linux, run:

$ dev_appserver.py .../jsonproxy

There might be a GUI involved on other platforms.  Just point it at
the jsonproxy directory.


Running tests:

There is a test for the xml2json utility, that run some sanity tests
on XML to JSON transformations  You can simply run it from the command line:

$ python xml2jsontests.py

Please make sure these tests pass if you'd like to present a patch to
the code.
